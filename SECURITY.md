## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can submit a vulnerability by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/LexiLabs-App/basic/issues/new).
Please include the following information:
* CVE ID (if it exists)
* What the vulnerability does within the app
* Any active exploitation (contact us via email at [security@lexilabs.app](mailto://security@lexilabs.app)

If your vulnerability is accepted, expect remediation within 72 hours.
If declined (which is unlikely), expect only one official response.
