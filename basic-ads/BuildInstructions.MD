# How to deal with building this garbage
1. Find a large cup. It must exist in the real world.
2. Fill said cup to the brim with some sort of caffeinated beverage.
3. Click `File` > `Invalidate Caches...`, check all boxes and hit `invalidate and restart`
4. Click `Sync` for gradle if banner exists. Ignore the flood of warning lights and klaxons.
4. Click `Build` > `Clean Cache`.  Ignore the plethora of errors
5. Once complete, click `Build` > `Rebuild Project`. NOTE: Despite religious preference, prayer is encouraged.
