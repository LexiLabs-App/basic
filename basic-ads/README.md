### How it works
Basic-Ads uses the existing Android and iOS Google AdMob libraries to display ads as `Composables`.
A [full walkthrough](https://medium.com/@robert.jamison/composable-ads-f8795924aa0d) is available on my Medium Blog, 
and there's also [an easy-start template](https://github.com/LexiLabs-App/Example-Basic-Ads).

## Preparation
For **Android**, complete the steps in AdMob's instructions:

* [Configure your app](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start#import_the_mobile_ads_sdk)

For **iOS**, complete the steps in AdMob's instructions:

* [Import the Mobile Ads SDK](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start#import_the_mobile_ads_sdk)

* [Update your Info.plist](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start#update_your_infoplist)

***NOTE: For Xcode 13+, you can update your [Custom iOS Target Properties](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/xcode-13-missing-info.plist/).***

## Installation
Add your dependencies from Maven
```toml
# in your 'libs.versions.toml' file
[versions]
kotlin = "+" # gets the latest version
compose = "+" # gets the latest version
lexilabs-basic = "+" # gets the latest version
google-play-services-ads = "+" # you did this during the preparation step

[libraries]
lexilabs-basic-images = { module = "app.lexilabs.basic:basic-ads", version.ref = "lexilabs-basic"}
google-play-services-ads = { module = "com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads", version.ref = "google-play-services-ads"}

[plugins] # make sure you're using the JetBrains plugin to import your composables
jetbrainsCompose = { id = "org.jetbrains.compose", version.ref = "compose" }
compose-compiler = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose", version.ref = "kotlin" }
```

then include the library in your gradle build
```kotlin
// in your 'composeApp/build.gradle.kts' file
plugins {
    alias(libs.plugins.jetbrainsCompose)
    alias(libs.plugins.compose.compiler)
}

sourceSets {
    commonMain.dependencies {
        implementation(libs.lexilabs.basic.ads)
        implementation(libs.google.play.services.ads)
    }
}
```

## Usage
Call [BasicAds.initialize] in your `commonMain` before building ads.
***NOTE: You do not need to initialize within each platform.***

```kotlin
// in your 'composeApp/src/commonMain/App.kt' file
@OptIn(DependsOnGoogleMobileAds::class)
@Composable
fun App() {
    // You'll need to access your platform-specific context (Android) or null (iOS) to pass as an `Any?` argument
    BasicAds.initialize(
        platformContext 
    )
    //...
}
```

Now you can build ads:

```kotlin
// in your 'composeApp/src/commonMain/AdScreen.kt' file
@Composable
fun AdScreen() {
    BannerAd() // Results in a Test Banner Ad being created
    // You'll need to access your platform-specific Activity (Android) or null (iOS) to pass as an `Any?` argument
    InterstitialAd(activity) // Results in a Test Interstitial Ad being created
    RewardedInterstitialAd(activity, {} ) // Results in a Test Rewarded Interstitial Ad (Beta) being created
    RewardedAd(activity, {}) // Results in a Test Rewarded Ad being created
}
```

If you want to customize your ad experience, you can take advantage of lambdas:
```kotlin
// in your 'composeApp/src/commonMain/AdScreen.kt' file
@Composable
fun AdScreen() {
    // You'll need to access your platform-specific Activity (Android) or null (iOS) to pass as an `Any?` argument
    RewardedAd(
        activity = activity,
        adUnitId = AdUnitId.autoSelect(
            "YOUR_ANDROID_AD_UNIT_ID",
            "YOUR_IOS_AD_UNIT_ID"
        ),
        onDismissed = {
            doSomethingElse()
        },
        onRewardEarned = {
            playSomeCoolSound()
        },
        onShown = {
            addValueToSomeCounter()
        }, 
        onImpression = {
            addValueToSomeTracker()
        }, 
        onClick = {
            incrementSomeValueSomewhere()
        }, 
        onFailure = {
            runTheBackupOption()
        }
    )
}
```

### \[Advanced Users Only\] How to deal with building this garbage
1. Find a large cup. It must exist in the real world.
2. Fill said cup to the brim with some sort of caffeinated beverage.
3. Click `File` > `Invalidate Caches...`, check all boxes and hit `invalidate and restart`
4. Click `Sync` for gradle if banner exists. Ignore the flood of warning lights and klaxons.
5. Click `Build` > `Clean Cache`.  Ignore the plethora of errors
6.Once complete, click `Build` > `Rebuild Project`. NOTE: Despite religious preference, prayer is encouraged.
